This is an example for me to use should I go long periods without using vim or vim-like controls.
First off I was able to get into this mode of writing by pressing the 'i' key to enter insert mode.
To get out of it I can hit <ESC> or something else if it has been remapped.

When you are back in the general view (normal mode aka command mode) you can navigate with the following:

h moves left char by char.
l moves right char by char.
j moves down line by line.
k moves up line by line.
f followed by a char will jump on top of the next instance of that char if any exist.
t followed by a char will go to the space right before the next instance of that char.
w will move to the next word (forward).
b will move to the next word (backward).
() will move up and down sentence by sentence.
{} will move up and down paragraph by paragraph.
/ will allow you to regex search at the bottom of the screen.

gg will move to the top of the file.
G will move to the bottom of the file.

Your movements will tracked in a form of navigation locations.
Ctrl + i will move forward in your navigation locations.
Ctrl + o will move backward in your navigation locations.

For editing text:
o will insert line beneath the current line.
R will enter replace mode where you overwrite where your cursor is and while you type.
x will delete forward.
X will backspace.

You can repreat actions by typing '.' in command mode.

Example:
This is text that I will repeat 10 times by typing '10.' without quotes.
This is text that I will repeat 10 times by typing '10.' without quotes.
This is text that I will repeat 10 times by typing '10.' without quotes.

yy will copy a line and p will paste it.

This is an example of a macro. I typed qa to start macro and name is a. I will press q to quite recording. Then press @a to replay it.
For example I forgot to add periods to the end of the yy lines above so I will do that now with a macro.
I went to the beginning of the line and had a sequence like this: qa A . jk j @a @a @a ...

Also Ctrl + shift + v works to paste from clipboard.
The following link provided a lot of this information for me.
